=====================

touch

This is the main source repository for WALA.  For more details on WALA, see <a
href="http://wala.sourceforge.net">the WALA home page</a> and <a href="https://wala.github.io/javadoc">WALA Javadoc</a>.

**Note:** historically, WALA has used Maven as its build system.
However, this WALA branch can also use Gradle as an alternative to
Maven.  See [the Gradle-specific README](README-Gradle.md) for more
instructions and helpful tips.
